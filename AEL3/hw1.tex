\textbf{Email from Mark:}\\
Hi Mark,\\
I received the wired mouse and the speakers I ordered in your e-shop but there are some problems with them. I am sending them back. Will you send me new ones?
I also need a new printer â€“ could you send me a comparison of the HP 3525, Canon iX6550 and Epson XP-102?\\
Thanks for your reply,\\
John

\textbf{Email to the colleague Peter:}\\
Hi Peter,\\
I'm sending you back broken wired mouse and speakers. The mouse has probably old firmware. Please, can you update driver or firmware and send it back to me? Thanks. I'm not sure what's wrong with speakers. Client says that it doesn't work, but it works fine to me. Please, can you check the possible problem and send it back with the wired mouse?\\
Thanks you,\\
Martin

\textbf{Reply to John:}\\
Hi John,\\
I'm sending new wired mouse and speakers to you. I apologize for caused inconvenience. About the printer. Do you prefer price or quality? The chepeast one is Epson XP-102. It cost only \$65, but it's quite slow (6 black / 3 colour pages per minute) and max resolution is 5760 x 1440 dpi. The most expensive printer is Canon iX6550. Anyway, my favourite  printer is HP 3525...\\
Please accept my apologize and say hello to Mary.\\
Mark Zuckerberk
